    <h2>My contributions</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO -> Write whatever you want -->
        Although my role in the team was implementing all the audio of the game and making it feel profesional, as we were a small team and there were many things to do, I've worked in many different areas apart from the audio one.
       
        Here are some of the tasks I have worked on: 
        <ul>
            <li>Spatial Audio</li>
            <li>Characters SFX</li>
            <li>UI SFX</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Radio</li>
            <li>Tutorial</li>
            <li>Quests/Missions</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO -> Write whatever you want -->
        Thanks to this project I've learned and improved a lot both personally and profesionally. I've learned on how to organize myself to face a project of this caliber and also understanding what working as a team means, since it is not letting everyone do their job, it is more about helping each other to do it as well as possible.
        As for the profesional side, I have improved in my programing and designing skills, but also I have learned a lot about how audio works in a game and how important is it to implement it.
        Finally, I can't end my conclusion without praising all my teammates for their commitment, effort and hard work that have made this project possible.

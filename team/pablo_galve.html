            <h2>My Contribution</h2>
            <p>
                My main responsibility was assuring the quality of our project through coordinating the team into reporting issues
                and solving them as efficient and smoothly as possible. <br>
                However, I was also involved in coding tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buildings internal structure</li>
                <li>Fog Of War</li>
                <li>Upgrades System</li>
                <li>Spawn System for units</li>
                <li>The website that you are reading right now</li>
                <li>Pack Data Into Zip</li>
                <li>Random AI factions</li>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO -->
        I really enjoyed being part of this project as I trully understood the value of team-work, cooperation and helping out each other. 
        <br><br>
        It is really important for me to have good communication levels with my team mates, as well as to follow agile methodologies to ensure that we are always organized and work in an efficient and healty environment. And I am pleased that my team did all of this from the very start.
        <br><br>
        At first we worked together and made face to face meetings periodically to set new goals and learn about failures to become a better team.
        However, due to the quarantine we had to rapidly switch to a remote environment. I can say that we all inmediatelly adapted smoothly to the new reality and continued the development. I would even say that the situation made us improve a lot more!        
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cooperating with my team</li>
            <ul>

    </ul>

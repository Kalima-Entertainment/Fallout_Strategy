    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO-> Write what are your responsibilities in this project -->
        Born in Olesa de Montserrat on January 4, 2000. I completed my technology General Certificate of Education.
        I have always been passionate about video games, and since I was little I have been playing all kinds, like Pokémon Saga when I was a child
        or more actually like Valorant.
        During a time of my life I became part of an esports club in which I competed in Counter Strike as a player and I also started
        with a group of colleagues the development of a multiplayer Minecraft server in which I was in charge of building scenarios and
        as a "programmer" of minigames. In turn, I also spent a lot of time in cooperative and survival games like Ark Survival Evolved.
        Also one of my hobbies is playing the guitar, so I studied music and guitar for eight years, at Trinity College London, graduating in 
        grade four of musical theory with distinction and grade two and three with merit.

    <h2>My contribution</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO -> Write whatever you want -->
        For this work I have focused more on the user interface part, but even so as a team, I have been touching a bit of everything and we have
        all been involved in the project.

        Even so these are the points where I have focused the most:

        <ul>

            <li>UI System and Art</li>
            <li>Brotherhood Sprites</li>
            <li>Menus System</li>
            <li>Easings</li>
            <li>Save And Load</li>
            <li>HUD (Cursor, Timer, Upgrades/ Spawn units System)</li>
            <li>Console</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO -> Write whatever you want -->
        As a summary of all these months of hard work, in which we have had very stressful moments with crashes and bugs, 
        I can say that I am proud of the video game that we have carried out, since it has served as a way to organize my work time much better and 
        to improve my programming knowledge.
        Still, I think it has helped us get a better game and work in a more united team.

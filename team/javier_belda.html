    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Born in Gran Canaria on September 26, 1997. After completing my science General Certificate of Education I got a Certificate of Higher Education in 2D animation, games and interactive environments.
		 I've always been a passionate fan of cinema and video games so I chose to study the second one because on my opinion: <i>"Video games are the most powerful way of entertainment, the value of the immersion that a video game
		can provide you is far beyond any other media".</i> My favorite video game is Bioshock Infinite, but I'm also a big fan of Uncharted saga, The last of us and Life is Strange saga among others.
		My models in the industry are Ken Levine & Amy Hennig. My dream is to live in a foreign country such as Canada and be part of the development of heavily-narrative games and then retire to become a teacher
		of game design.

    <h2>My contribution</h2>
    <p>
       Even thought my official charge was Management since most of the tasks were assigned by the Team Leader and normally there weren't many delays I didn't have to work a lot on this area. I'm proud to appoint
	   that unlike other projects we didn't necessarily work in only one area of the project, each one of us made things for all the areas in addition to that every member of the team helped to polish the game.
	   Some things I worked on that I like to emphasize are:
	   <ul>
		<li>Transitions</li>
		<li>Win/Lose (code+art)</li>
		<li>Map design and creation</li>
		<li>Trailer</li>
		<li>Deathclaws</li>
		<li>Radio</li>
		<li>Tutorial</li>
		</ul>
		Apart from that I like to think that we worked like a team and we helped each other with some tasks.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        This project has been a real roller coaster, with very stressful moments and others more fulfilling, but overall i think it was enriching, I have improved my skills in programming but most of all in design and in
		how to organize myself and work as a team even in the hardest situations. I can only speak wonders about all the members of my team and I will be happy to work with them in the future. If you want to contact me feel free to make it through my social media linked above!.
		To conclude I'd like to stand out the amazing work of our Team Leader, his guidance and wisdom have made this game possible.

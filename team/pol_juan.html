    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO-> Write what are your responsibilities in this project -->
      Hey!!! My name is Pol and i'm the game designer of the project. Born in Barcelona on May 22, 2000 and with a lot of creativity since i was a child. I have played videogames my entire life, and all the kinds possible(platform, mmorpg,shooters,etc), but it wasn`t since i got much older when i start asking me questions about the games i was playing. Why i love doing wall-jumps with Mario? Why i like doing a consecutive combos in the air with Sonic? Why Dark Souls is difficult? Questions that awake my curiosity, curiosity that drove me to decide my future. And so it is, i choose to be a game designer. My dream is to work in Nintendo or Sega, not only because are two of the most vetererants companies in the market, because i love their ideas. I grew with them, and i want to help growing their legacy. So be ready world, because the next Miyamoto is incoming.

        First of all, stressful, but also amazing. And that's normal, because we are talking about doing a videogame not inflate a balloon. It's not something you can do fast and easy. No, is a long  and difficult path you have to follow. But thankfully you do this path with more people,that'll become a team. Team that in a certain point will become a family. And i'm very happy and grateful with this family, all of them.
        I have learnt a lot about design and improved my programing skills, but the most important part i'm glad to have being able to express my creativity in the project. And for that, i would like to conclude by expressing my gratitute to the lead Audio manager, the lead Artist, the lead Programmer, the Manager,the QA Manager,The User Interface manager and most important the Team Leader of the group. Thank you guys for letting me work with you!!

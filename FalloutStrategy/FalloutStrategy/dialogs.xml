  <option text="We must get them out of here right now." response="That is the spirit! Go get your troops."/>
  <option text="I do not want to. My life is too precious to be risked." response="You better get going or I will get you out of our faction."/>

  <option text="Water and caps are our main priority right now. We can survive with what we already have." response="That is good, but caps are not good to eat. Trust me."/>
  <option text="No way I am risking my troops for such a silly reason. If needed they will eat stones but we will stand here." response="If you do not get out there and get at least 200 of food you won’t get your daily ration of food."/>

  <option text="Man is the best weapon nowadays. Thanks to him, we are living in this graveyard called world." response="It is a pity but you are right. However, with this weapon the blood of your men will not paint the battlefield."/>
 </dialog>
 <dialog statement="That is all boy. Get out there, get the resources we need and do it within 10 minutes or those damn Deathclaws will get to us and dying of hunger or thirst will be the minor of our problems."/>
